# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Case Sensitivity Issue**
- **Problem**: `vite.config.js` had base path `/AdvancedStudyapp/` but repository name is `AdvancedStudyApp` 
- **Fix**: Updated base path to `/AdvancedStudyApp/` (note the capital 'A')

### 2. **Empty Source Files**
- **Problem**: `index.html` and `src/main.js` were empty
- **Fix**: Created complete source files with full StudyPro application

### 3. **Missing Permissions**
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow lacked necessary permissions
- **Fix**: Added required permissions block to workflow

## Current Configuration

### vite.config.js
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/AdvancedStudyApp/' : '/',
  // ... rest of config
})
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

## Manual Deployment Steps

If automated deployment isn't working, follow these steps:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy using gh-pages:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Alternative: Manual GitHub Pages setup:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "gh-pages" branch
   - Set folder to "/ (root)"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. **404 Error on GitHub Pages**
- Ensure repository name matches the base path in `vite.config.js`
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the correct branch is selected for deployment

### 2. **Assets Not Loading**
- Confirm base path is correct in `vite.config.js`
- Check that all asset paths are relative or use the correct base

### 3. **Build Failures**
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Clear Vite cache: `rm -rf .vite`
- Ensure all source files are properly created

### 4. **Service Worker Issues**
- Service worker paths need to be updated for GitHub Pages
- Check console for service worker registration errors

## Repository Settings Checklist

- [ ] Repository name matches base path in vite.config.js
- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled
- [ ] Correct branch is selected (gh-pages)

- [ ] All source files are committed and pushed

## Files Updated

1. `vite.config.js` - Fixed base path case sensitivity
2. `index.html` - Created complete HTML structure
3. `src/main.js` - Created full application logic
